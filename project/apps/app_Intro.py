Environmental protection could be a huge issue, but it could also be specific to the daily life of every individual. In fact, our generations have witnessed colossal changes in the global environment, but not every one of us is truly aware of the severity of the problem. Therefore we aim to develop a website (and app also) that literally speaks with data, which intuitively displays the global climate- and environment-related data fluctuations in the past decades. In conclusion, our motivation is to arouse peopleâ€™s focus on environmental issues by displaying global changes intuitively with data and graphs.")
